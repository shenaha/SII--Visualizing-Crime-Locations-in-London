#### Data Collected
The latest complete copy of all the crime data can be downloaded in CSV format from the archive page from data.police.uk/data/archive/latest.zip. URLs are structured consistently in the following format so you can download newer versions programmatically each month (https://data.police.uk/data/archive/[year]-[month].zip).
